- 👋 Hi, I’m **@Harold-Mitts** – Technical Program Manager at Microsoft.
- 🎯 I turn complex technical problems into clear, actionable workflows that help people get things done.
- 💡 My focus: AI-powered Copilot solutions (Search, Connectors, Extensibility) that actually deliver customer success.

**The Challenge**: Technical complexity shouldn't be a barrier to productivity. Too many teams struggle with tools that could transform their work - they just need someone to bridge the gap between "feature" and "outcome."

**My Toolkit**: I orchestrate solutions using M365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, VSCode + GitHub Copilot, PowerShell, Python, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - always grounding intelligence with Microsoft Graph to ensure AI answers are accurate, not hallucinated.

**Interests**: Technical program management, systems thinking, agents, skills, prompts, and the continuous evolution of Copilot Studio and GitHub Copilot.

**How I Work**: The metrics below reflect my bias toward action over analysis. I invest heavily in context orchestration and tooling infrastructure because **the right scaffolding accelerates everyone's work.** Problem Crystallization scores lower by design - I'd rather iterate on working prototypes than debate specifications.
